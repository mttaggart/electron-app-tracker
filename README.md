# Electron Vulnerability Tracker

This Notebook tracks known [Electron](https://electronjs.org) apps for vulnerabilities. This knowledge is valuable given the frequent release of vulns in the browser technologies that comprise Electron, although these apps often fly under the radar for remediation.

This work supersedes the lists hosted on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLLFYCO0FMAu1ob6mnYCapW8dnx-HXunbf_zc9QLXlM/edit?usp=sharing) and [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/mttaggart/02ed50c03c8283f4c343c3032dd2e7ec).

## The Lists

* [CSV](https://github.com/mttaggart/electron-app-tracker/blob/main/electron_apps.csv)
* [JSON](https://github.com/mttaggart/electron-app-tracker/blob/main/electron_apps.json)

## Methodology

The original list of apps was sourced from [Electron's own site](https://electronjs.org/apps), and has been amended with community support since then.

This script both sources from and dynamically updates the CSV (and JSON) files holding the app info. If an app has a repo associated, then the repo is queried, using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing. We're avoiding the GitHub API to avoid rate limiting. Each repo is then examined for `package.json` files. If none is found in the repo root, immediate subdirectories are queries. For sanity, we only query immediate subdirs and we only query `main` and `master` branches. That means some apps will be missed in the scrape due to using version branches that are ahead of `main`.

If a `package.json` file is found, it is analyzed for the presence of `electron` as a dependency. This version is then tested against known-patched versions of Electron for each listed vulnerability. If the semantic version is equal or greater, we show `patched` for that vuln; otherwise, we show `vulnerable`. Each scrape is timestamped, so new data will update existing data.

## Additional CVEs

Electron will continue to inherit vulnerabilities, so this tracker is designed to add CVEs to its checks as time goes on. All that's required is adding to the defined dict in [`electron_tracker/vulncheck.py`](https://github.com/mttaggart/electron-app-tracker/blob/main/electron_tracker/vulncheck.py)

## Contributing 

Contributing is easy! Simply open a Pull Request updating `electron_apps.csv` with a `manual` access type. Please provide evidence of the versions of the apps you're updating. We are particularly in need of any updates on the apps listed as `manual`.

And thank you for helping with the effort!
